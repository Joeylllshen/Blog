I"	<p>This is what a post on your blog looks like. This template is especially well suited for posting nice succint blurbs, much like <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin</a> does. Of course, it will also work well with longer posts, and you can change the number of posts per page in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file. Thereâ€™s no guarentee this blog will make you write as well as he does, but it will present your writings in a beautiful, clean, and distraction-free way. Try to write a little bit, every day.</p>
